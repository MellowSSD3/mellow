                                Meditation is hard to define in terms of modern-day medicine because of its many different spiritual, social, and cultural contexts. Its roots also go far back: historical documents trace meditation to Hindu traditions in India as early as 1500 BCE before it spread to China in the 5thcenturies BCE.<sub>2</sub> According to psychology.com, a lot of meditation practices share the common goal of directing attention towards one point of reference. It may involve focusing on breathing, a certain object, or a phrase commonly referred to as a “mantra." It also typically involves avoiding distracting thoughts about the past and future and focusing on the present moment; oftentimes, this is described as “mindfulness.” One definition of meditation accepted by the medical community says it:
                                “…refers to a family of self-regulation practice that focus on training attention and awareness in order to bring mental processes under greater voluntary control and thereby foster general mental well-being and development and/or specific capacities such as calm, clarity, and concentration” <sub>3</sub>

                            <h2>Meditation is a stress-buster </h2>
                            <p class="lead">
                                Because meditation is most strongly associated with relaxing the mind, medical researchers are most interested in how practicing it regularly affects stress.  Stress is any natural response of the human body or mind to a new demand.<sub>4</sub> It allows us to keep up with new, short-term demands such as an athletic competition or looming work deadline.
                                However, prolonged stress- known as “chronic stress”- can lead to detrimental, long-term effects on the mental and physical health of individuals. Harmful forms of stress include routine stress, such as a long commute to work, or traumatic stress of a sudden event such as the loss of a loved one. Chronic stress can negatively impact our health in the following ways: 4

                            <p class="lead">Chronic stress is associated most heavily with increased levels of a biomarker called cortisol, which InsideTracker tests for. Cortisol is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenals in response to increased levels of stress.<sub>5</sub> Our bodies need increased levels of cortisol to carry out many essential functions such as breaking down energy. However, prolonged, elevated levels of cortisol in response to chronic stress can lead to depression, a repressed immune system, and degradation of body tissues, including muscle.<sub>6</sub> Over time, this can lead to a variety of diseases and make you less productive and unhappy. Clearly, we all want something that fights stress and helps manage cortisol levels...like meditation. </p>

                                There's proof in the meditation pudding, so to speak. In 2013, researchers recruited 34 Chinese graduates (16 men and 18 women) for a four-week long intervention study. The subjects were an average age of 20.87 years old and no prior experience in meditation practice. Additionally, they had no history of autoimmune disease (i.e. Rheumatoid Arthritis and HIV) or mental illnesses such as depression. This group was pretty healthy, overall.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">At the beginning of the study, researchers assigned the subjects to one of two groups. The first group of 17 served as the intervention group and performed an integrative body-mind training (IBMT) procedure that encompassed body relaxation, mental imagery, and mindfulness training associated with meditation. The researchers also included relaxing background music. The method ultimately emphasizes no control of one’s thoughts and an achievement of “restful alertness”.</p>
                            <p class="lead">The second group of 17 participated in a modern-day practice originating in the west called relaxation therapy (RT). RT is a form of relaxation that involves relaxing different muscle groups in the legs, shoulders, arms, head, face, chest, back, and abdomen with the assistance of a tutor. People performing RT usually have their eyes closed in a pattern and are forced to focus on relaxation and feelings of heaviness and warmth.</p>
                            <p class="lead">The researchers instructed all subjects complete education sessions about their respective relaxation methods for five days of four consecutive weeks. They received instruction both via CD and a certified meditation instructor. Two weeks and four weeks after starting their training, the subjects participated in a stress-intervention test with three-stages:</p>
                            <ul class="list-icons lead">
                                <li><i class="icon-check pr-10"></i> First, they rested for 5 minutes</li>
                                <li><i class="icon-check pr-10"></i> Then they performed 3 minutes of difficult mental arithmetic to induce stress</li>
                                <li><i class="icon-check pr-10"></i> Afterwards, the subjects participated in 20 minutes of their respective stress intervention (RT or IBMT)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="lead">Researchers evaluated the levels of salivary cortisol before the stress, immediately after the stress, and immediately after the 20 minute practice. The levels of cortisol at a normal state of rest are referred to as “basal cortisol.”</p>

                            <p class="lead">The findings of this study are supported by several others. A study from last year on health care works showed that a 30 hour integrated meditation program quickly reduced basal cortisol levels and increased performance. <sub>8</sub> These subjects also became more resistant to stressful events after practicing meditation. <sub>8</sub> A Thai study from 2013 observed a 19.9% decrease in basal cortisol levels in 30 second- year medical schools <span style="font-weight: bold;">after practicing mindfulness meditation for just four days. <sub>9</sub></span> Researchers of a four month study in which subjects practiced meditation daily for four months concluded “that repeated practice of… meditation technique reverses effects of chronic stress significant for health.” <sub>10</sub></p>
                            <p class="lead">One benefit that these studies overlooked is the fact that by decreasing cortisol, meditation also improve your immunity. This is because cortisol directs your body’s resources from the immune system and decreases your white blood cell production. Therefore, when looking at your InsideTracker results, pay close attention your white blood cell count to see what affects meditation has on you.</p>
                            <p class="lead" style="font-weight:bold;">Key Takeaways: Practicing integrative meditation, which includes mental imagery and relaxing music, twice a day for 15 minutes is an effective stress management tool before challenging events. Conventional western techniques such as relaxation therapy are less effective at reducing stress and lowering cortisol. The effects of meditation are stronger as you progressively use it more.</p>
                            <p class="lead" style="font-weight:bold;">Recommendation: If you are experiencing high levels of cortisol due to general stress or anxiety related to a demanding event such as a sports competition or academic test, consider practicing integrative meditation for as little as 5 minutes a day. Then, see if you can consistently meditate for 15-20 minutes once a day. To monitor the effects of meditation on stress, use InsideTracker to learn your cortisol levels as well as your white blood cell count.</p>

                            <p class="lead">In ancient times, Buddhist monks on the quest for greater spirituality weren’t the only ones who practiced meditation. Ninjas used it to sharpen their focus and reflexes so they could perform more. And Samurais practiced it daily to get that extra edge over their opponent.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Doesn’t it seem counterintuitive that meditation — where someone seems to be resting — makes someone more agile? Well, as usual, science holds the answer.</p>
                            <p class="lead">
                                According to research, <span style="font-weight:bold;">meditation is a highly effective way to increase reaction time, a key indicator of one’s ability to react to new environmental stresses.</span> In a one week study, 10 college students who never practiced meditation completed 40 minutes of either nap, meditation, or control activities. Then, all of these subjects experienced one night of complete sleep deprivation followed by 40 minutes of meditation.
                                All meditators were assessed through a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), a timed task that measures the speed one takes to respond to a new visual stimulus such as a green or red light. When assessing the data, all 10 meditators improved their PVT reaction times after meditation (with a greater improvement after 10 minutes). In contrast, all but one subject lowered their reaction time after naps. Furthermore, after sleep deprivation, reaction time to tasks improved considerably after practicing meditation for 40 minutes. As a result of these findings, the researchers stated “these results suggest that meditation provides at least a short-term performance improvement even in novice meditators.” <sub>11</sub>
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead" style="font-weight:bold;">
                                Key Takeaways: Research indicates that meditation is a highly effective way to improve reaction time, a key indicator of alertness and agility.
                                Recommendations: If you’re looking to get more agile, strongly consider incorporating meditation into your routine for 10-20 minutes a day. However, if you are ultimately blessed with ninja-like reflexes because of meditation, we highly recommend you don’t use them to harm anybody!

                            <p class="lead">Because the practice of meditation emphasizes relaxation and awareness, the bulk of clinical research on its impact on the body have focused on processes related to the mind. Recently, some scientists have sought to evaluate if meditation has an impact on heart health.</p>
                            <p class="lead">At InsideTracker, we get a snapshot of heart health by measuring triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. Each biomarker has crucial functions to optimal body function. However, elevated levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol can greatly increase one’s risk of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart disease. On the flipside, low levels of HDL cholesterol can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.</p>

                                Last year, a group of researchers assessed the use of transcendental meditation (TM) in lowering the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In TM, subjects repeat a sound or chant called mantra to gain greater focus. They searched several literature databases for randomized controlled studies (RCTs) lasting at least three months that included healthy adults or adults with a high risk for developing CVD.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">All studies evaluated at least one of three sets of outcomes: </p>

                                    Due to the authors’ rigorous standards, only four studies that included a total of 420 subjects were included.  In each study, participated practiced meditation for 15 to 20 minutes per session twice a day. Because all studies were so short, none of them assessed mortality related to cardiovascular illness. Additionally, there was a lot of variation between trials in terms of blood pressure. None of the trials measured biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease or other risk factors such as type 2 diabetes.
                                </li>

                                Because of the very limited scope of the research, the authors of the evaluation stated that “we could draw no conclusions as to the effectiveness of TM for the primary prevention of CVD.” <sub>12</sub>Additionally, they stated that “more and larger, long-term, high-quality trials are needed” to establish a potential relationship between meditation and prevention of CVD.12
                                That being said, meditation still holds the potential to benefit your cardiovascular health. One clinical trial on post-menopausal female found that regular practice of meditation lowered triglycerides and LDL cholesterol.<sub>13</sub> A study from India observed a significant inverse association between individuals who regularly practice meditation and levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol the blood.<sub>14</sub> Another South Korean study showed that subjects that walked for 40 minutes a day for three weeks along with regular meditation experienced greater declines in lipids compared to a control group. <sub>15</sub>
                                High-quality intervention studies indicate that regular meditation practices lowers levels of blood lipids. A year-long study on 150 African-American subjects unveiled that 15-20 minutes of transcendental meditation are far more effective in lowering blood pressure than conventional relaxation therapy or health promotion.<sub>16</sub> A recent meta-analysis of 19 studies on the short-term effects of meditation stated that “the regular practice of Transcendental Meditation may have the potential to reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure by ~4.7 and 3.2mmHg, respectively. These are clinically meaningful changes.” <sub>17</sub>
                                Finally, according to the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">American Heart Association</span>, meditation lowers the risk of cardiovascular illness by decreasing stress and cortisol.

                            <p class="lead" style="font-weight:bold;">Key Takeaways: High-quality research assessing the impact of meditation on cardiovascular health is limited in scope. A couple of promising studies indicate that two 15-20 minute sessions of meditation daily may lower blood pressure when compared to health promotion and other relaxation techniques. One study suggests that meditation coupled with walking three times per week and no dietary changes may help optimize blood lipids. </p>
                            <p class="lead" style="font-weight:bold;">Recommendations: If you want to improve your lipid related biomarkers and your cardiovascular health, consider using a more research-proven intervention in your recommendation engine such aerobic exercise or avocado. However, you can try meditation and see what effects it has on your lipid biomarkers, blood pressure, and cardiovascular health.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Meditation is an approach to training the mind, similar to the way that fitness is an approach to training the body. But many meditation techniques exist — so how do you learn how to meditate?</p>
                            <p class="lead">“In Buddhist tradition, the word ‘meditation’ is equivalent to a word like ‘sports’ in the U.S. It’s a family of activities, not a single thing,” University of Wisconsin neuroscience lab director Richard J. Davidson, Ph.D., told The New York Times. And different meditation practices require different mental skills.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Concentration meditation involves focusing on a single point. This could entail following the breath, repeating a single word or mantra, staring at a candle flame, listening to a repetitive gong, or counting beads on a mala. Since focusing the mind is challenging, a beginner might meditate for only a few minutes and then work up to longer durations.</p>
                            <p class="lead">In this form of meditation, you simply refocus your awareness on the chosen object of attention each time you notice your mind wandering. Rather than pursuing random thoughts, you simply let them go. Through this process, your ability to concentrate improves.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Mindfulness meditation encourages the practitioner to observe wandering thoughts as they drift through the mind. The intention is not to get involved with the thoughts or to judge them, but simply to be aware of each mental note as it arises.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Through mindfulness meditation, you can see how your thoughts and feelings tend to move in particular patterns. Over time, you can become more aware of the human tendency to quickly judge an experience as good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant. With practice, an inner balance develops.</p>
                            <p class="lead">In some schools of meditation, students practice a combination of concentration and mindfulness. Many disciplines call for stillness — to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the teacher.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Colour plays a role in our daily lives, sometimes subtly, sometimes dramatically. Some ancient cultures practiced chromo therapy, or using colours to heal. Chromo therapy, which is sometimes called light therapy, continues to be a popular holistic healing treatment. Psychologists and medical researchers have conducted hundreds of studies on the effect of colour on the psyche. Colour is used in advertising to induce us to formulate certain feelings about products and places. For example, studies have shown that the combination of blue and yellow attracts more buyers than any other combination; the color red has been shown to negatively impact students’ performance on exams; rooms painted blue has been shown to have a calming effect on prisoners. For the same reasons, focusing on color during your daily mediation can have a significant impact on your well-being.</p>
